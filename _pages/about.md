I am a Ph. D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of 
Waterloo. I joined the Broadband Communications Research (BBCR) Lab, University of Waterloo, in 2021, under the 
supervision of [Professor Xuemin (Sherman) Shen](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=Bjl3GwoAAAAJ&hl=en). 
Before that, I received the B.Eng. degree and the M.A.Sc. degree in 
2018 and 2021, respectively, from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) , where I 
was supervised by [Professor Ying-Chang Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HybIiJ8AAAAJ&hl=en) and 
 [Professor Yiyang Pei](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=-NBbi8YAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests lie in AI for managing wireless networks and digital twin-assisted networking for AI service provision towards 6G communications.
